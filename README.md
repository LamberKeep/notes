# What is it?
Linux and code reference notes collection with basic, tips and formatted man pages.

## Who might benefit from this?
First of all, this may be useful to people who have just started learning Linux and its commands.

This repository is not a panacea (!); studying the commands proposed in it provides only superficial knowledge about the capabilities of the operating system; for a more in-depth study, it is better to study manuals and documentation from official sites.
